Dmitry N. Zotkin is an adjunct associate professor in UMIACS and a member of the Perceptual Interfaces and Reality Laboratory, the Center for Automation Research (CfAR), and the Computer Vision Laboratory.

Zotkin is working with audio and acoustic signal processing. His main research interests are spatial audio capture and reproduction.

Zotkin also works in related areas, such as microphone arrays, auditory scene analysis, and fast numerical methods for the acoustic wave equation.

He is an author/co-author for two book chapters, 12 journal papers and more than 40 referred conference publications. Zotkin was the main author of a 2006 paper describing a novel fast personalization/customization method for a personal 3-D audio system. UMD has obtained a patent on the relevant technology and has licensed it to companies aimed at widespread use of personalized spatial audio at the consumer level.

Zotkin is a regular reviewer for several audio-related IEEE Transactions and for the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America. He has served on the program committee or as a reviewer for many of the major conferences in his research area. He is also a member of the Acoustical Society of America.

Zotkin received a doctorate in computer science from the University of Maryland in 2002.
