abstract: A head-related transfer function (HRTF) generation system includes one or more processors configured to retrieve first image data of a first ear of a subject, compare the first image data with second image data of a plurality of second ears to identify a particular second ear of the plurality of second ears matching the first ear, identify a template HRTF associated with the particular second ear, and assign an HRTF to the subject based on the template HRTF.
