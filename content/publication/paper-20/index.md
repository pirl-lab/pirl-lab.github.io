abstract: A spatial-audio recording system includes a spatial-audio recording device including a plurality of microphones, and a computing device. The computing device is configured to determine a plane-wave transfer function for the spatial-audio recording device based on a physical shape of the spatial-audio recording device and to expand the plane-wave transfer function to generate a spherical-harmonics transfer function corresponding to the plane-wave transfer function. The computing device is further configured to retrieve a plurality of signals captured by the microphones, determine spherical-harmonics coefficients for an audio signal based on the plurality of captured signals and the spherical-harmonics transfer function, and generate the audio signal based on the determined spherical-harmonics coefficients.
